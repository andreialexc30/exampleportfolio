<h1>About the project</h1>
This is a pretty simple example of a web developer's portfolio different from freeCodeCamp's challenge.
<h2>Information</h2>
I made this project while I was surfing YouTube for ideas. I stumbled upon Kevin Powell's code-along tutorial for this and I decided to give it a go.
<h2>What I've learned</h2>
Watching Kevin Powell's code-along helped me discover more things about CSS and it also helped in making me understand them. I learned about custom properties and how to get better at responsive design. It also helped me with naming conventions and better html/css coding etiquette.
